I recently finished my undergrad at UC San Diego, where I majored in computer science. I spent the summers working at startups and a IT firm. Before that, I worked as a software engineer in the Korean military. Outside of work, I’ve been developing iOS apps and experimenting with Raspberry Pi’s. I’m looking for a full-time software engineer position at a larger corporation to get some exposure to and learn from larger projects.

I love learning and using new technologies to build products and services that solve problems or are just really cool to share. I've worked with a variety of different languages, frameworks, and libraries.

You can find out more about my experience by reading my [Resume](/resume/) or exploring my [projects](/projects).
